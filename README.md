# First-Agent-Using-smolagents
create your very first Agent capable of performing actions such as image generation, web search, time zone checking and much more!
To make this Agent, we’re going to use smolagents, a library that provides a framework for developing your agents with ease.

This lightweight library is designed for simplicity, but it abstracts away much of the complexity of building an Agent, allowing you to focus on designing your agent’s behavior.
